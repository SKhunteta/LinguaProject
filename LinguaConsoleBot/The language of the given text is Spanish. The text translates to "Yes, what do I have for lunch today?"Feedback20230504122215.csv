"I'll provide feedback on your Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and coherence.

1. ""Gracias Lingua. Cual es tu dia hoy?"" - This sentence is a bit unclear. If you meant to ask how my day is going, you could say: ""Gracias Lingua. ¿Cómo va tu día hoy?"".

2. ""Si, que almuerzo hoy?"" - The correct form would be: ""Sí, ¿qué almuerzo hoy?"". Remember to use the accent on ""Sí"" (yes) and include the opening question mark ""¿"" at the beginning of the question.

3. ""Gracias Lingua. Quiero aprender espanol contigo"" - There's a small typo here. The correct sentence would be: ""Gracias Lingua. Quiero aprender español contigo"". Remember to use the ""ñ"" in ""español"".

Overall, you were able to maintain the context of the conversation and understand/respond to the AI's prompts appropriately. Keep practicing, and feel free to ask any questions or request further assistance!"
